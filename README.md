# NASA's- Mission to Psyche Game

*Welcome to the Mission to Psyche game! This is an educational game where you will learn about NASAâ€™s Psyche mission. You will have the opportunity to engage with mini-games that are both fun and educational, relating to the instruments NASA is using on this groundbreaking mission.*

**About the Psyche Mission**

The Psyche mission, led by NASA, aims to explore a unique metal asteroid named Psyche, which orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. Unlike typical rocky or icy asteroids, Psyche appears to be made entirely of metal, primarily nickel and iron. This mission seeks to understand the building blocks of planet formation by studying this rare metallic asteroid.

## Mini-Games->

**1. Gamma Ray Spectrometer Mini-game**

Press '*s*' to start the Spectrometer mini-game. Collect gamma rays and neutrons using the spacecraft. 
Adjust orbit speed and size using the arrow keys.

__Why Spectrometer Mini-Game?__

The decision to include the Spectrometer mini-game in the Mission to Psyche game was driven by its crucial role in NASA's Psyche mission. 
Spectrometers are instrumental in measuring gamma rays and neutrons emitted by celestial bodies like the Psyche asteroid. 
By simulating this instrument in a mini-game format, players can experience firsthand the challenges and intricacies of collecting and analyzing these radiation signatures.

## Importance to NASA:

Understanding Asteroid Composition: Spectrometers help scientists analyze the composition of asteroids by detecting and measuring the energy of gamma rays and neutrons.
This information is vital for understanding the geological makeup of Psyche and other asteroids.

Exploring**Planetary**Origins: By studying the elemental composition of asteroids like Psyche, scientists can gain insights into the processes that shaped our solar system during its early stages of formation. 
This knowledge is fundamental to our understanding of planetary origins and evolution.
Mission Planning and Data Collection: The data collected by spectrometers onboard spacecraft like Psyche informs mission planning and enhances our ability to conduct targeted observations. 
This, in turn, maximizes the scientific return from space missions.




**2. Magnetic Field Mini-game**

Press '*m*' to begin the Magnetic Field mini-game. Memorize patterns to scan the asteroid's magnetic field. 
Match patterns correctly to progress.

**Why Magnetic Field Mini-Game**
The Magnetic Field mini-game was chosen to highlight another critical aspect of the Psyche mission: the study of magnetic fields. NASA's Psyche spacecraft will carry a magnetometer to measure the asteroid's magnetic field, providing valuable information about its internal structure and history. 
By incorporating a mini-game focused on memorization and pattern recognition, players can engage with the concept of magnetic field mapping in a hands-on way.



# Importance to NASA: 
Mapping Magnetic Fields: Understanding the magnetic properties of asteroids like Psyche can reveal insights into their formation and evolutionary history. 
By mapping the asteroid's magnetic field, scientists can infer its internal structure and composition.
Investigating Planetary Differentiation: The presence or absence of a magnetic field can provide clues about the processes that led to planetary differentiation. 
Studying Psyche's magnetic field could shed light on how metallic asteroids like Psyche formed and evolved.
Scientific Collaboration and Discovery: The data collected by the magnetometer onboard Psyche will contribute to scientific collaboration and discovery, advancing our understanding of planetary science and space exploration.



# About the Psyche Mission:

*Importance of the Psyche Mission*

The Psyche mission holds significant importance in understanding the formation and evolution of planets. 
By studying Psyche, scientists hope to gain insights into the processes that occurred during the early stages of our solar system's formation. 
Additionally, understanding metallic asteroids like Psyche could provide valuable information for future asteroid mining endeavors.
By including the Spectrometer and Magnetic Field mini-games in the Mission to Psyche game, we aim to educate and inspire players about the importance of these instruments in NASA's Psyche mission. 
Through interactive gameplay, players can experience the excitement of scientific exploration and gain a deeper appreciation for the groundbreaking research conducted by NASA and its partners.



**Goal of the Mission to Psyche Game**

The main goal of creating the Mission to Psyche game is to make learning about the Psyche mission engaging and accessible to a wide audience. By incorporating mini-games that simulate the instruments used in the mission, players can immerse themselves in the scientific exploration of this fascinating asteroid. We aim to inspire curiosity and interest in space exploration, particularly among students and enthusiasts.
